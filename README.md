# ruby_project_euler
Repo for Project Euler solutions in Ruby.

This project is purely for the author's own educational benefit and enjoyment. It's a bit of a sandbox to play around with various concepts: Ruby code, RSpec tests, design patterns, data structures, algorithms, meta programming, etc. There will be a lot of comments to myself--describing why I did something in a certain way or something cool I learned.
